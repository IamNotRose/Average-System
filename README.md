# Average-System
An average system of my academic institution.

In this script we have some logical operations with variables and conditionals.
Two tests are applied to define the average of a student, we have the probability of missing or grade lower than 4 in one or two of the tests, thus making New Chance as an alternative.
And we have Av3 to improve a not so good grade or, even with New Chance, below 4. In these systems we will define the final average of a student in the semester.
